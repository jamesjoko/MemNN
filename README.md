Evaluation/performance will be measured in recall: tp / (tp + fn). Recall measures the ability of the classifier to identify all of the positive samples.
A true positive is when a neighbor is identified in the correct i-th nearest position.
A false negative is when a neighbor is identified in either the incorrect i-th nearest position or is not a k-nearest neighbor.
