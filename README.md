# CS 490LDA (Wang) Group 1 Project, Memory-Based Nearest Neighbor Search (MemNN)

## Members: Annie Wong, Alan Cao, James Joko, Jerry Chen, Jim He

Dataset is located [here](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/)

Evaluation/performance will be measured in recall: tp / (tp + fn). Recall measures the ability of the classifier to identify all of the positive samples.
A true positive is when a neighbor is identified in the correct i-th nearest position.
A false negative is when a neighbor is identified in either the incorrect i-th nearest position or is not a k-nearest neighbor.

The data used contains 4 files:

- base.fvecs: The vectors in which a search is performed
- groundtruth.ivecs: pre-computed k nearest neighbors. test labels/true values
- learn.fvecs: vectors to find the parameters involved in a particular method (we will probably not use this)
- query.fvecs: test set

For the 10k vectors data, the sizes of these arrays are (10000, 128), (100, 100), (25000, 128), and (100, 128) respectively.

For the 1M vectors data, the sizes of these arrays are (1000000, 128), (10000, 100), (100000, 128), and (10000, 128) respectively.
